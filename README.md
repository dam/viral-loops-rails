# VLoopsRails

* Implementing a client for the Viral Loops API


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'viral-loops-rails', git: 'https://github.com/dam/viral-loops-rails', require: 'viral_loops_rails'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install
    
Then, create an initializer in your Rails application with the following code:

```ruby
require 'viral_loops_rails'

VLoopsRails.configure(api_token: 'token', campaign_id: 'campaign_id'])
```

## How to integrate the widgets in your application

You can include helpers directly in your template:

```erb
<%= vloops_script_tag(type: :refer_a_friend, position: 'top-right') %>
```

Or add filters in your controllers:

```ruby
after_action only: :new do
  vloops_rails_auto_include(type: :refer_a_friend, position: 'top-right')
end
```
    
## Widgets currently implemented

## Usage of the API client

Configure the client:

```ruby
VLoopsRails.configure(api_token: 'your_api_token')
```

Then you can use the API:

```ruby
client = VLoopsRails::Client.new
client.scroll_pending_rewards.each do |reward|
  p reward
end
```

Please look at the code inside the _spec/_ folder for examples.
